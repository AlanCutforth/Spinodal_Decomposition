# Spinodal_Decomposition
 University work for the spinodal decomposition project for Order, Disorder and Fluctuations.

IsingModel.py:
Monte-Carlo simulation simulating the Ising model under an ideal quench at temperature = 0K (which would occur at time t = 0s). Spinodal decomposition can be observed as the same-spin states begin to 'clump' over time.

LandauModel.py:
Monte-Carlo simulation of the Landau equation under an ideal quench at temperature = 0K (which would occur at time t = 0s). Spinodal decomposition can be observed as areas of greater positive and negative values begin to converge and 'clump', as with the Ising model.
